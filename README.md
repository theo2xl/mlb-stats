# mlb-stats

This directory will hold the solutions to two different mlb related software problems.

The [etl](etl) directory contains code for an ETL process which downloads the 2014 batting average leaders and displays them ranked by their 2014 wOBA.

I will next create a directory for the problem below...

## JavaScript/UI/UX Coding Exercise

For this exercise you will be developing a mini web application for viewing the Cubs MLB
team roster.

Use the [roster.json](static/roster.json) file that describes the Cubs current roster to
drive your application.

### Required Features:
* The user must be able to save and view short text notes on any player.

### Upon completion you will deliver the following:
* JavaScript, HTML and other resources required to run your application.
* At least one screenshot of your application
* An explanation of the technologies used
* directions for starting your web app

### Notes
* Your application does not need to utilize an application server. Ideally it
will run simply by opening an HTML file in a web browser.
* Specify the browser you tested with. Either Chrome or Firefox is fine.
* For this simple exercise you should use HTML5 web storage to save the notes
on a player.
