# App Information

## How to run the application
Forking this repo and opening [roster.html](roster.html) in a modern web-browser should be all that is needed.

You can see a screenshot of the web-app here [roster-screenshot](roster-screenshot.png)

This was tested in Chrome v41

## Technologies used
* AngularJS
 * This is the main framework for the roster application. It is perfect for static web applications and built to consume JSON.
 * No web server is required, just the javascript.
* Bootstrap
 * This was used for the css of the app.
 * Used for the grid layout, responsive-design, glyphicons and buttons
* Google Web Fonts
 * Allow a different font to be used easily for a more interesting presentation.

# Initial Problem is below

## JavaScript/UI/UX Coding Exercise

For this exercise you will be developing a mini web application for viewing the Cubs MLB
team roster.

Use the roster.json file that describes the Cubs current roster to drive your application.

### Required Features:
* The user must be able to save and view short text notes on any player.

### Upon completion you will deliver the following:
* JavaScript, HTML and other resources required to run your application.
* At least one screenshot of your application
* An explanation of the technologies used
* directions for starting your web app

### Notes
* Your application does not need to utilize an application server. Ideally it
will run simply by opening an HTML file in a web browser.
* Specify the browser you tested with. Either Chrome or Firefox is fine.
* For this simple exercise you should use HTML5 web storage to save the notes
on a player.
